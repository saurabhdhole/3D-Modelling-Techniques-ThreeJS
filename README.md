# 3D Modeling Techniques with Three.js

This repository contains sample Three.js code demonstrating different 3D modeling techniques discussed in the research paper: *Various 3D Modelling Techniques and Point Clouds*. Each folder contains a sample HTML and JavaScript file for a specific modeling technique.

## üìú Overview

This repository provides visual examples of various 3D modeling techniques using Three.js, including:

1. **Box Modeling**
2. **Polygon Modeling**
3. **Procedural Modeling**
4. **Digital Sculpting**
5. **Photogrammetry (Simulated Point Cloud)**
6. **Point Cloud (Simulated)**

## üìÇ Contents

### 1. **Box Modeling**
Box Modeling uses basic geometric shapes like cubes and spheres to create models. The example demonstrates a rotating cube created using Three.js.

- **Folder:** `BoxModelling`
- **Files:** `boxModelling.html`, `boxModelling.js`

### 2. **Polygon Modeling**
Polygon Modeling focuses on constructing 3D models using vertices, edges, and faces. The example demonstrates a simple rotating triangle.

- **Folder:** `PolygonModelling`
- **Files:** `polygonModelling.html`, `polygonModelling.js`

### 3. **Procedural Modeling**
Procedural Modeling generates complex shapes based on algorithmic inputs. The example demonstrates a rotating Torus Knot.

- **Folder:** `ProceduralModelling`
- **Files:** `proceduralModelling.html`, `proceduralModelling.js`

### 4. **Digital Sculpting**
Digital Sculpting involves deforming a mesh using brush-like interactions. The example demonstrates a sphere being deformed by simulating user interaction.

- **Folder:** `DigitalSculpting`
- **Files:** `digitalSculpting.html`, `digitalSculpting.js`

### 5. **Photogrammetry (Simulated Point Cloud)**
Photogrammetry typically relies on visual data and algorithms to create 3D point clouds. This example simulates a point cloud with random points for demonstration.

- **Folder:** `Photogrammetry`
- **Files:** `photogrammetry.html`, `photogrammetry.js`

### 6. **Point Cloud (Simulated)**
This example creates a dense point cloud structure that approximates the shape of a human skull using a Three.js point cloud renderer.

- **Folder:** `PointCloud`
- **Files:** `skullPointCloud.html`, `skullPointCloud.js`

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-Modelling-Techniques-ThreeJS.git
2. **Navigate** to the desired folder and open the corresponding .html file in a browser to visualize the modeling technique.

3. **Customize the JavaScript** code as needed to experiment with different parameters or create your own models.

**üõ† Requirements**
A modern web browser with JavaScript support.
An internet connection to load the Three.js library from the CDN or download it locally.
**‚öôÔ∏è Customization**
You can change the color, size, and other parameters of the models directly in the JavaScript files.
For advanced visualizations, modify the geometry generation logic within the JavaScript files.
