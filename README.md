Procedural Modeling
Digital Sculpting
Photogrammetry (Simulated Point Cloud)
Human Skull Point Cloud (Simulated)
Contents
1. Box Modeling
Box Modeling uses basic geometric shapes like cubes and spheres to create models. The example demonstrates a rotating cube created using Three.js.

Files: boxModelling.html, boxModelling.js
2. Polygon Modeling
Polygon Modeling focuses on constructing 3D models using vertices, edges, and faces. The example demonstrates a simple rotating triangle.

3. Procedural Modeling
Procedural Modeling generates complex shapes based on algorithmic inputs. The example demonstrates a rotating Torus Knot.

4. Digital Sculpting
Digital Sculpting involves deforming a mesh using brush-like interactions. The example demonstrates a sphere being deformed by simulating user interaction.

5. Photogrammetry (Simulated Point Cloud)
Photogrammetry typically relies on visual data and algorithms to create 3D point clouds. This example simulates a point cloud with random points for demonstration.

6. Human Skull Point Cloud (Simulated)
This example creates a dense point cloud structure that approximates the shape of a human skull using a Three.js point cloud renderer.

How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-Modelling-Techniques-ThreeJS.git
Navigate to the desired folder and open the corresponding .html file in a browser to visualize the modeling technique.

Customize the JavaScript code as needed to experiment with different parameters or create your own models.

Requirements
A modern web browser with JavaScript support.
An internet connection to load the Three.js library from the CDN or download it locally.
Customization
You can change the color, size, and other parameters of the models directly in the JavaScript files.
For advanced visualizations, modify the geometry generation logic within the JavaScript files.
