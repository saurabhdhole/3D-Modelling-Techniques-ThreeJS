# 3D Modelling Techniques with Three.js

This repository contains sample Three.js code demonstrating different 3D modeling techniques discussed in the research paper: *Various 3D Modelling Techniques and Point Clouds*. Each folder contains a sample HTML and JavaScript file for a specific modeling technique.

## 1. Box Modelling
Box Modeling uses basic geometric shapes like cubes and spheres to create models. The `boxModelling.html` file contains the setup code to run this visualization.

## 2. Polygon Modelling
Polygon Modelling focuses on constructing 3D models using vertices, edges, and faces. You can find the code in the `polygonModelling.html` and `polygonModelling.js` files.

## 3. Procedural Modelling
Procedural Modelling generates complex models based on algorithmic functions and inputs. The code provided demonstrates the creation of a procedural Torus Knot.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open any `.html` file in a browser to visualize the corresponding modeling technique.
3. Each modeling technique can be further customized using the JavaScript code provided.
